## Installation

If you do not have Node.js installed, first go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions to install Node.js. Once you have Node.js Installed or if you already had it on your machine use git to clone the project repository from GitHub. After cloning, run 'npm i' or 'npm install' from the command line in the directory of the project to install all neccessary dependencies for this project. Now you are good to go!

## Usage

Using the command line from the main directory of the project repository run 'npm start' in order to initialize the app. You will be given a welcome message and asked to confirm if you want to continue with the app, input 'y' to continue, otherwise input 'n' and receive a goodbye message and the app will end. If you chose to continue you will be prompted to input the employee's name, then id, and then their email, please input the appropriate response to each question. Now you will be asked what the role of the employee is, select their relevant role using the arrow keys and press the 'enter' key on your keyboard. Depending on the role you chose you will be asked to input either their office number, GitHub username, or the name of their school. Now that you have inputted all the required employee information confirm whether you want to add an additional employee with 'y' to add another or 'n' to go ahead and generate the HTML file with the current employee(s) you have inputted. If you chose to add an additional employee you will be given the prompts again starting with the employee's name. Continue through this process as many time as you need to in order to add all the employees you want.
